# Hello, I'm Gabriel! 👋

Welcome to my profile!

I am a tech enthusiast living in southern **Brazil**. I hold a degree in **Computer Science** from the Federal University of Technology – Paraná (**UTFPR**). I have many hobbies, and when I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me doing one of these activities:

- 🎮 Enjoying **video games** or **board games** with my friends.
- ⚽️ Playing **soccer** with the college team.
- 🏈 Practicing **American football** with my city's team.
- 🏐 Trying to improve my **volleyball** skills.
- 🍳 **Cooking** my favorite recipes.
- 🎵 Learning something new, like playing the **cavaquinho**.

I believe technology has changed my life and shaped who I am today.
